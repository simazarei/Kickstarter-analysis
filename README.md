## Overview of Project
Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.There are 4,014 different campaing between 2009 to 2017 took place throughout the world . The purpose is to find out what makes a campaign project _Successful_ or _Failed_.

# Results
## What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date? 
1)In overall Theater Campaign has always higher amount of successful outcome than failed or Canceled ones based on their launch time.
2) Succussful outcome between Jan to June has an increase but it has a slop on June, and from June to end of Dec it went down . But Failed Outcomes didnt falctuate a lot, and canceled Outcome stayed stabel within based on the luanch Date.
May and Juen with 111 and 100 outcome have the moste amount of Succussful Outcome while Dec with almost 40 has the least amout of Successful Outcome. And for the Failed outcome
## What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

What are some limitations of this dataset?
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
